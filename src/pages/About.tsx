        <p>
          Founded in 2020, SynthiumAI emerged from a simple yet powerful vision: to make artificial intelligence accessible, 
          practical, and transformative for businesses of all sizes. What began as a small team of AI researchers and 
          business strategists has grown into a global leader in enterprise AI solutions.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Our journey started when our founders recognized a critical gap in the market â€“ while AI technology was 
          advancing rapidly, businesses struggled to implement it effectively. SynthiumAI was born to bridge this gap, 
          combining cutting-edge technology with practical business applications.
